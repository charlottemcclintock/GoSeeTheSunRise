# Go See the Sun Rise

I wanted a way to have sunrise and sunsets on my calendar so I would go up to my roof and see the sun rise or set.

Do you also want to see the sun rise or set? Enter the following URL into the calendar subscription option in your calendar app of choice:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlottemcclintock/GoSeeTheSunRise/master/sun.ics`

data from [Sunrise Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api)

## ideas for mods/extentions:

- ~~add sun emoji to title~~
- add fun sunny phrases to description
- ~~add alert to calendar event~~
