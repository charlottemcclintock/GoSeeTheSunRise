# Go See the Sun Rise

I wanted a way to have sunrise and sunsets on my calendar so I would go up to my roof and see the sun rise or set.

data from [Sunrise Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api)

## ideas for mods/extentions:

- add sun emoji to title
- add fun sunny phrases to description
- make downloadable/addable online?
